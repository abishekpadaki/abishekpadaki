### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github.

A bit about me:

I'm a Full-stack developer with a proven track record of working with cutting-edge front-end technologies such as React, NodeJS, MongoDB, etc. Proven ability to lead and develop projects, engineer CI/CD processes, and incorporate analytics and graph databases for personalized user experiences. I have experience in developing projects such as end-to-end SaaS applications, Malware prediction systems using deep learning techniques and developing Smart Contracts for Supply Chain Applications.

I am enthusiastic about topics pertaining to the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence, and concepts such as Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) and adaptive workflow solutions.

Additionally, I enjoy observing the changes and revolutions made in the blockchain domain, and have also worked on a few projects on the Ethereum blockchain.
